Political Philosophy

• He was a strong proponent of individual liberty and the protection of individual rights against despotism or coercive institutions and was opposed to the legacy of hereditary privilege or aristocratic traditions.
	o An early advocate of total separation of church and state, he also was the founder and architect of the University of Virginia 	and the most eloquent American proponent of individual freedom as the core meaning of the American Revolution.
	o He returned to Virginia in October 1776 and immediately launched an extensive project for the reform of the state’s legal code 	to bring it in line with the principles of the American Revolution. Three areas of reform suggest the arc of his political vision: 	first, he sought and secured abolition of primogeniture, entail, and all those remnants of feudalism that discouraged a broad 	distribution of property; second, he proposed a comprehensive plan of educational reform designed to assure access at the lowest 	level for all citizens and state support at the higher levels for the most talented; third, he advocated a law prohibiting any 	religious establishment and requiring complete separation of church and state.
	o Taken together, these legal reforms capture the essence of Jefferson’s political philosophy, which was less a comprehensive body 	of thought than a visionary prescription. He regarded the past as a “dead hand” of encrusted privileges and impediments that must 	be cast off to permit the natural energies of individual citizens to flow freely. The American Revolution, as he saw it, was the 	first shot in what would eventually became a global battle for human liberation from despotic institutions and all coercive 	versions of government.
	o In truth, unlike his friend and disciple James Madison, Jefferson did not think primarily in constitutional categories. His 	major concern about the new Constitution was the absence of any bill of rights. He was less interested in defining the powers of 	government than in identifying those regions where government could not intrude.
	o Adams and Jefferson effectively, even dramatically, embodied the twin impulses of the revolutionary generation. As the “Sage of 	Monticello,” Jefferson represented the Revolution as a clean break with the past, the rejection of all European versions of 	political discipline as feudal vestiges, the ingrained hostility toward all mechanisms of governmental authority that originated 	in faraway places. As the “Sage of Quincy (Massachusetts),” Adams resembled an American version of Edmund Burke, which meant that 	he attributed the success of the American Revolution to its linkage with past practices, most especially the tradition of 	representative government established in the colonial assemblies. He regarded the constitutional settlement of 1787–88 as a shrewd 	compromise with the political necessities of a nation-state exercising jurisdiction over an extensive, eventually continental, 	empire, not as a betrayal of the American Revolution but an evolutionary fulfillment of its promise.
	
• He was deeply opposed to the centralization and expansion of power in the central government. He wanted to see power dispersed and distributed across the states as a check against the emergence of despotism.
	o As Jefferson saw it, the entire Federalist commitment to an energetic central government with broad powers over the domestic 	economy replicated the arbitrary policies of Parliament and George III, which the American Revolution had supposedly repudiated as 	monarchical and aristocratic practices, incompatible with the principles of republicanism. Jefferson sincerely believed that the 	“principles of ’76” were being betrayed by a Federalist version of the “court party,” whose covert scheme was to install monarchy 	and a pseudo-aristocracy of bankers and “monocrats” to rule over the American yeomanry
	o There was a good deal of nervous speculation whether the new American nation could survive a Jefferson presidency. The entire 	thrust of Jefferson’s political position throughout the 1790s had been defiantly negative, rejecting as excessive the powers 	vested in the national government by the Federalists. In his Virginia Resolutions of 1798, written in protest of the Alien and 	Sedition Acts, he had described any projection of federal authority over the domestic policy of the states as a violation of “the 	spirit of ’76” and therefore a justification for secession from the Union.
	o The major message of Jefferson’s inaugural address was conciliatory. Its most famous line (“We are all republicans—we are all 	federalists”) suggested that the scatological party battles of the previous decade must cease. He described his election as a 	recovery of the original intentions of the American Revolution, this after the hostile takeover of those “ancient and sacred 	truths” by the Federalists, who had erroneously assumed that a stable American nation required a powerful central government. In 	Jefferson’s truly distinctive and original formulation, the coherence of the American republic did not require the mechanisms of a 	powerful state to survive or flourish. Indeed, the health of the emerging American nation was inversely proportional to the power 	of the federal government, for in the end the sovereign source of republican government was voluntary popular opinion, “the 	people,” and the latent energies these liberated individuals released when unburdened by government restrictions.
	o In 1804 Jefferson was easily reelected over Federalist Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, winning 162 electoral votes to Pinckney’s 	14. Initially, at least, his policies as president reflected his desire for decentralization, which meant dismantling the 	embryonic federal government, the army and navy, and all federal taxation programs, as well as placing the national debt, which 	stood at $112 million, on the road to extinction.
	o In 1819, during the debate in Congress over the Missouri Compromise, he endorsed the expansion of slavery into all the western 	territories, precisely the opposite of the position he had taken in the 1780s. Though he continued to insist that slavery was a 	massive anomaly, he insisted even more strongly that it was wrong for the federal government to attempt any effort at 	emancipation. In fact he described any federal intrusion in the matter as a despotic act analogous to George III’s imperial 	interference in colonial affairs or Hamilton’s corrupt scheme to establish a disguised form of monarchy in the early republic. His 	letters to fellow Virginians during his last years reflect a conspiratorial mentality toward the national government and a clear p	reference for secession if threatened with any mandatory plan for abolition
	o Jefferson’s position on domestic policy during the 1790s was a variation on the same ideological dichotomy. As Hamilton began to 	construct his extensive financial program—to include funding the national debt, assuming the state debts, and creating a national 	bank—Jefferson came to regard the consolidation of power at the federal level as a diabolical plot to subvert the true meaning of 	the American Revolution. 

Economic Policy

• He argued for open markets, free trade, no tariffs, and international trade
	o Jefferson’s diplomatic overtures to establish a market for American tobacco and to reopen French ports to whale oil produced 	meager results, his efforts to create an alliance of American and European powers to contest the terrorism of the Barbary pirates 	proved stillborn, and his vision of open markets for all nations, a world without tariffs, seemed excessively visionary
	
Foreign Policy

• Had a pro-French foreign policy and wanted to steer the United State away from England and closer to France which he saw as embodying republican values.
	o During his tenure as secretary of state (1790–93), foreign policy was his chief responsibility. Within the cabinet a three-	pronged division soon emerged over American policy toward the European powers. While all parties embraced some version of the 	neutrality doctrine, the specific choices posed by the ongoing competition for supremacy in Europe between England and France 	produced a bitter conflict. Washington and Adams, who was serving as vice president, insisted on complete neutrality, which in 	practice meant tacking back and forth between the two dominant world powers of the moment. Alexander Hamilton pushed for a pro-	English version of neutrality—chiefly commercial ties with the most potent mercantile power in the world. Jefferson favored a pro-	French version of neutrality, arguing that the Franco-American treaty of 1778 obliged the United States to honor past French 	support during the war for independence, and that the French Revolution embodied the “spirit of ’76” on European soil. Even when 	the French Revolution spun out of control and began to devour its own partisans, Jefferson insisted that these bloody convulsions 	were only temporary excesses justified by the larger ideological issues at stake.
	o His foreign-policy vision was resolutely moralistic and highly ideological, dominated by a dichotomous view of England as a 	corrupt and degenerate engine of despotism and France as the enlightened wave of the future.

• He struggled to enforce neutrality and had to turn to the power of centralized government which ran counter to his beliefs.
	o But Jefferson’s major disappointment had its origins in Europe with the resumption of the Napoleonic Wars, which resulted in 	naval blockades in the Atlantic and Caribbean that severely curtailed American trade and pressured the U.S. government to take 	sides in the conflict. Jefferson’s response was the Embargo Act (1807), which essentially closed American ports to all foreign 	imports and American exports. The embargo assumed that the loss of American trade would force England and France to alter their 	policies, but this fond hope was always an illusion, since the embryonic American economy lacked the size to generate such 	influence and was itself wrecked by Jefferson’s action. Moreover, the enforcement of the Embargo Act required the exercise of 	precisely those coercive powers by the federal government that Jefferson had previously opposed. By the time he left office in 	March 1809, Jefferson was a tired and beaten man, anxious to escape the consequences of his futile efforts to preserve American 	neutrality and eager to embrace the two-term precedent established by Washington.

Personality, Temperament, Communication Style, Cognitive Style

• By all accounts he was an obsessive student, often spending 15 hours of the day with his books, 3 hours practicing his violin, and the remaining 6 hours eating and sleeping.
• Although he handled no landmark cases and came across as a nervous and somewhat indifferent speaker before the bench, he earned a reputation as a formidable legal scholar. He was a shy and extremely serious young man.
• The two competing impulses that would persist throughout his life—namely, to combine an active career in politics with periodic seclusion in his own private haven.
• The huge gap between his lyrical expression of liberal ideals and the more attenuated reality of his own life has transformed Jefferson into America’s most problematic and paradoxical hero.
• But the Paris years were important to Jefferson for personal reasons and are important to biographers and historians for the new light they shed on his famously elusive personality. The dominant pattern would seem to be the capacity to live comfortably with contradiction. For example, he immersed himself wholeheartedly in the art, architecture, wine, and food of Parisian society but warned all prospective American tourists to remain in America so as to avoid the avarice, luxury, and sheer sinfulness of European fleshpots.
• Jefferson’s deep aversion to controversy made him withdraw from the cutting edge of the antislavery movement once he experienced the sharp feelings it aroused
• Although the Federalist Party was dead as a national force, pockets of Federalist opposition still survived, especially in New England. Despite his eloquent testimonials to the need for a free press, Jefferson was outraged by the persistent attacks on his policies and character from those quarters, and he instructed the attorneys general in the recalcitrant states to seek indictments, in clear violation of his principled commitment to freedom of expression. He was equally heavy-handed in his treatment of Aaron Burr, who was tried for treason after leading a mysterious expedition into the American Southwest allegedly designed to detach that region from the United States with Burr crowned as its benevolent dictator. The charges were never proved, but Jefferson demanded Burr’s conviction despite the lack of evidence. He was overruled in the end by Chief Justice John Marshall, who sat as the judge in the trial.
Miscellaneous Information and Other Characteristics
• By the middle years of the decade two distinctive political camps had emerged, calling themselves Federalists and Republicans (later Democratic-Republicans). But an embryonic version of the party structure was congealing, and Jefferson, assisted and advised by Madison, established the rudiments of the first opposition party in American politics under the Republican banner.
• The partnership between Jefferson and Madison, labeled by subsequent historians as “the great collaboration,” deserves special attention. John Quincy Adams put it nicely when he observed that “the mutual influence of these two mighty minds on each other is a phenomenon, like the invisible and mysterious movements of the magnet in the physical world.” Because the notion of a legitimate opposition to the elected government did not yet exist, and because the term party remained an epithet that was synonymous with faction, meaning an organized effort to undermine the public interest, Jefferson and Madison were labeled as traitors by the Federalist press.
• Always operating through intermediaries, Jefferson paid several journalists to libel Adams, his old friend but current political enemy, and offered the vice presidency to Aaron Burr in return for delivering the electoral votes of New York.
• The major achievement of his first term was also an act of defiance, though this time it involved defying his own principles. In 1803 Napoleon decided to consolidate his resources for a new round of the conflict with England by selling the vast Louisiana region, which stretched from the Mississippi Valley to the Rocky Mountains. Although the asking price, $15 million, was a stupendous bargain, assuming the cost meant substantially increasing the national debt. More significantly, what became known as the Louisiana Purchase violated Jefferson’s constitutional scruples. Indeed, many historians regard it as the boldest executive action in American history. But Jefferson never wavered, reasoning that the opportunity to double the national domain was too good to miss. The American West always triggered Jefferson’s most visionary energies, seeing it, as he did, as America’s future, the place where the simple republican principles could be constantly renewed. In one fell swoop he removed the threat of a major European power from America’s borders and extended the life span of the uncluttered agrarian values he so cherished.

Representative Prose Style

• "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, in that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.—That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,—That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government..."
