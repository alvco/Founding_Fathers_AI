Political Philosophy

• He was the foremost champion of a strong central government for the new United States.
	o Convinced that the Articles of Confederation were the source of the country’s weakness and disunion.
	o Hamilton went to Philadelphia as an uncompromising nationalist who wished to replace the Articles of Confederation with a strong 	centralized government
	o Under his plan, the national government would have had unlimited power over the states.
	o Hamilton developed a bold and masterly program designed to build a strong union, one that would weave his political philosophy 	into the government. His immediate objectives were to establish credit at home and abroad and to strengthen the national 	government at the expense of the states.

• He wanted strong leadership in the executive branch.
	o Like Washington, Hamilton had deplored parties, equating them with disorder and instability. He had hoped to establish a 	government of superior persons who would be above party. Yet he became the leader of the Federalist Party, a political 	organization in large part dedicated to the support of his policies. Hamilton placed himself at the head of that party because he 	needed organized political support and strong leadership in the executive branch to get his program through Congress
	o The political organization that challenged the Hamiltonians was the Republican Party (later Democratic-Republican Party) created 	by James Madison, a member of the House of Representatives, and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson.

• He was a conservative, nationalist, and a supporter of strong central government who was suspicious of democracy owing to a perception that it led to the erosion property rights 
	o Most of all, Hamilton was one of America’s first great nationalists. He believed in an indivisible nation where the people would 	give their loyalty not to any state but to the nation. Although a conservative, he did not fear change or experimentation. The 	conservatism that led him to denounce democracy as hostile to liberty stemmed from his fear that democracy tended to invade the 	rights of property, which he held sacred. His concern for property was a means to an end. He wished to make private property 	sacred because upon it he planned to build a strong central government, one capable of suppressing internal disorders and assuring 	tranquility. His economic, political, military, and diplomatic schemes were all directed toward making the Union strong. 	Hamilton’s most enduring monument was the Union, for much of it rested on his ideas.

Economic Policy

• He was a proponent of economic nationalism and mercantilism and state intervention in the economic sphere
	o Through payment by the central government of the states’ debts, he hoped to bind the men of wealth and influence, who had 	acquired most of the domestically held bonds, to the national government.
	o Advocated a national bank called the Bank of the United States and modeled after the Bank of England. With the bank, he wished 	to solidify the partnership between the government and the business classes who would benefit most from it and further advance his 	program to strengthen the national government.
	o In the Report on Manufactures, the fourth, the longest, the most complex, and the most farsighted of his reports, he proposed to 	aid the growth of infant industries through various protective laws. Basic to it was his idea that the general welfare required 	the encouragement of manufacturers and that the federal government was obligated to direct the economy to that end. In writing his 	report, Hamilton had leaned heavily on The Wealth of Nations, written in 1776 by the Scottish political economist Adam Smith, but 	he revolted against Smith’s laissez-faire idea that the state must keep hands off the economic processes, which meant that it 	could provide no bounties, tariffs, or other aid.

Personality, Temperament, Communication Style, Cognitive Style

• Hamilton was a man both of action and of ideas, but all his ideas involved action and were directed toward some specific goal in statecraft. Unlike Benjamin Franklin or Thomas Jefferson, he did not have a broad inquisitive mind, nor was he speculative in his thinking in the philosophical sense of seeking intangible truths. He was ambitious, purposeful, a hard worker, and one of America’s administrative geniuses.

• What renders him fascinating to biographers are the streaks of ambition, jealousy, and impulsiveness that led him into disastrous personal clashes—the rupture with Washington in 1781, which luckily did him no harm; an adulterous affair in 1791, which laid him open to blackmail; the assault on Adams that doomed Federalist prospects in 1800; and perhaps even the duel in which he died. The union of a mind brilliantly tuned to the economic future with the temperament of a Hotspur is rare.

• Intensely ambitious, he became a serious and successful student.

• Hamilton tried to manipulate the electoral college so as to make Pinckney president. Adams won the election, and Hamilton’s intrigue succeeded only in sowing distrust within his own party.


Foreign Policy

• He favored strong ties to England.
	o In foreign affairs the Federalists favored close ties with England, whereas the Republicans preferred to strengthen the old 	attachment to France. In attempting to carry out his program, Hamilton interfered in Jefferson’s domain of foreign affairs. 	Detesting the French Revolution and the egalitarian doctrines it spawned, he tried to thwart Jefferson’s policies that might aid 	France or injure England and to induce Washington to follow his own ideas in foreign policy. Hamilton went so far as to warn 	British officials of Jefferson’s attachment to France and to suggest that they bypass the secretary of state and instead work 	through himself and the president in matters of foreign policy.

• He was suspicious of France and wanted to steer the United States away from France and closer toward England
	o At the same time, British seizure of U.S. ships trading with the French West Indies and other grievances led to popular demands 	for war against Great Britain, which Hamilton opposed. He believed that such a war would be national suicide, for his program was 	anchored on trade with Britain and on the import duties that supported his funding system. Usurping the power of the State 	Department, Hamilton persuaded the president to send John Jay to London to negotiate a treaty. Hamilton wrote Jay’s instructions, 	manipulated the negotiations, and defended the unpopular treaty Jay brought back in 1795, notably in a series of newspaper essays 	he wrote under the signature Camillus; the treaty kept the peace and saved his system.
	o When war broke out between France and England in February 1793, Hamilton wished to use the war as an excuse for jettisoning the 	French alliance of 1778 and steering the United States closer to England, whereas Jefferson insisted that the alliance was still 	binding. Washington essentially accepted Hamilton’s advice and in April issued a proclamation of neutrality that was generally 	interpreted as pro-British.
	o When France broke relations with the United States, Hamilton stood for firmness, though not immediate war; however, after the 	failure of a peace mission that President Adams had sent to Paris in 1798, followed by the publication of dispatches insulting to 	U.S. sovereignty, Hamilton wanted to place the country under arms. He even believed that the French, with whom the United States 	now became engaged in an undeclared naval war, might attempt to invade the country. Hamilton sought command of the new army, 	though Washington would be its titular head.

• He was a foreign policy realist
	o In foreign policy he was a realist, believing that self-interest should be the nation’s polestar; questions of gratitude, 	benevolence, and moral principle, he held, were irrelevant.

Miscellaneous Information and Characteristics

• He publicly defended the Boston Tea Party, in which Boston colonists destroyed several tea cargoes in defiance of the tea tax.

• In 1774–75 he wrote three influential pamphlets, which upheld the agreements of the Continental Congress on the nonimportation, nonconsumption, and nonexportation of British products and attacked British policy in Quebec.

• He advanced the argument that the Constitution was the source of implied as well as enumerated powers and that through implication the government had the right to charter a national bank as a proper means of regulating the currency. This doctrine of implied powers became the basis for interpreting and expanding the Constitution in later years.

• Through the Post he hailed the purchase of Louisiana in 1803, even though New England Federalists had opposed it. Some of them talked of secession and in 1804 began to negotiate with Burr for his support. Almost all the Federalists but Hamilton favoured Burr’s candidacy for the governorship of New York state.


Representative Example of Prose Style

• "Energy in the Executive is a leading character in the definition of good government. It is essential to the protection of the community against foreign attacks; it is not less essential to the steady administration of the laws; to the protection of property against those irregular and high-handed combinations which sometimes interrupt the ordinary course of justice; to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition, of faction, and of anarchy."
