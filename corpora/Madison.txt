Political Philosophy

• He argued for a separation of powers which would provide checks and balances against the abuse and concentration of power and believed that this would protect individual rights.
	o There his Virginia, or large-state, Plan, put forward through Governor Edmund Randolph, furnished the basic framework and 	guiding principles of the Constitution, earning him the 	title of father of the Constitution. Madison believed keenly in 	the value of a strong government in which power was well controlled because it was well balanced among the branches.
	o Elected to the new House of Representatives, Madison sponsored the first 10 amendments to the Constitution—the Bill of Rights—	placing emphasis in debate on freedom of religion, 	speech, and press. 

• He believed in a strong central government but was also skeptical of government overreach and the excessive concentration of power and his views evolved in this are over time.
	o Following the ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1781, Madison undertook to strengthen the Union by asserting 	implied power in Congress to enforce financial 	requisitions upon the states by military coercion. This move failing, he worked 	unceasingly for an amendment conferring power to raise revenue and wrote an eloquent address 	adjuring the states to avert 	national disintegration by ratifying the submitted article.
	o He split with Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton over methods of funding the war debts. Hamilton’s aim was to strengthen the 	national government by cementing men of wealth to it; 	Madison sought to protect the interests of Revolutionary veterans.
	o Hamilton’s victory turned Madison into a strict constructionist of the congressional power to appropriate for the general 	welfare. He denied the existence of implied power to 	establish a national bank to aid the Treasury. Later, as president, he 	asked for and obtained a bank as “almost [a] necessity” for that purpose, but he contended that it was 	constitutional only 	because Hamilton’s bank had gone without constitutional challenge. 

Economic Policy

• He argued for economic nationalism.
	o Although he had fully supported Jefferson’s wartime shipping embargo, Madison reversed his predecessor’s policy two weeks after 	assuming the presidency by secretly notifying both 	Great Britain and France, then at war, that, in his opinion, if the 	country addressed should stop interfering with U.S. commerce and the other belligerent continued to do so, 	“Congress will, at 	the next ensuing session, authorize acts of hostility…against the other.

Personality, Temperament, Communication Style, Cognitive Style

• The Federalist Party was killed by its opposition to the war, and the president was lifted to a pinnacle of popularity. Madison’s greatest fault was delay in discharging incompetent subordinates, including Secretary of War John Armstrong, who had scoffed at the president’s repeated warnings of a coming British attack on Washington and ignored presidential orders for its defense.

• On leaving the presidency, Madison was eulogized at a Washington mass meeting for having won national power and glory “without infringing a political, civil, or religious right.”

• Delegate William Pierce of Georgia wrote that, in the management of every great question, Madison “always comes forward the best informed Man of any point in debate.” Pierce called him “a Gentleman of great modesty—with a remarkable sweet temper. He is easy and unreserved among his acquaintances, and has a most agreeable style of conversation.”

• Unwillingness to admit error was a lifelong characteristic. 

Foreign Policy

• He believed in an economic nationalist style of foreign policy advancing US interests.
	o Believing that England was bent on permanent suppression of American commerce, Madison proclaimed nonintercourse with England on 	November 2, 1810, and notified France on the same 	day that this would “necessarily lead to war” unless England stopped its 	impressment of American seamen and seizure of American goods and vessels. One week earlier, unknown to 	Congress (in recess) or 	the public, he had taken armed possession of the Spanish province of West Florida, claimed as part of the Louisiana Purchase.
	o Madison left Congress in 1797, disgusted by John Jay’s treaty with England, which frustrated his program of commercial 	retaliation against the wartime oppression of U.S. maritime 	commerce. The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 inspired him to 	draft the Virginia Resolutions of that year, denouncing those statutes as violations of the First Amendment of the 	Constitution and affirming the right and duty of the states “to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil.”

Miscellaneous Information and Characteristics

• To promote ratification he collaborated with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay in newspaper publication of the Federalist papers (Madison wrote 29 out of 85), which became the standard commentary on the Constitution.

• He hated slavery, which held him in its economic chains, and worked to abolish it through government purchase of enslaved people and their resettlement in Liberia, financed by sale of public lands.

• He rose quickly to leadership against the devotees of state sovereignty and enemies of Franco-U.S. collaboration in peace negotiations, contending also for the establishment of the Mississippi as a western territorial boundary and the right to navigate that river through its Spanish-held delta. Defending Virginia’s charter title to the vast Northwest against states that had no claim to western territories and whose major motive was to validate barrel-of-rum purchases from Indian tribes, Madison defeated the land speculators by persuading Virginia to cede the western lands to Congress as a national heritage.

• There his Virginia, or large-state, Plan, put forward through Governor Edmund Randolph, furnished the basic framework and guiding principles of the Constitution, earning him the title of father of the Constitution.

• The break over funding split Congress into Madisonian and Hamiltonian factions, with Fisher Ames now calling Madison a “desperate party leader” who enforced a discipline “as severe as the Prussian.” (Madisonians turned into Jeffersonians after Jefferson, having returned from France, became secretary of state.)

Representative Example of Prose Style

• "There are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by removing its causes; the other, by controlling its effects. There are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the one, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the other, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests. It could not be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was worse than the disease."
